# Digital Circuit Design
Digital Circuit Design with the SystemVerilog (SV) Hardware Description Language (HDL).

Digital circuits are implemented in SV code and tested with user-defined custom SV testbenches. The circuit outputs are displayed both in a VCD (Value Change Dump) file and graphically in the GTKWave waveform analyser.
