The AND gate is implemented as a SV file *and2.sv*. The testbench file *and2_tb.sv* is used to test all outputs of the AND gate for all possible inputs.

The output *y* of and2.sv for all inputs 00, 01, 10, 11 is shown in the GTKWave waveform analyser as:

This is the expected output behaviour of an AND gate, such that the output is 1 iff the input is 11.
